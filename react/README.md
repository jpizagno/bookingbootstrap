# Simple Data Entry Web Page

This website will allow one to manage bookings. The data management includes create, update, delete.  Login is included along with manager mappings.  Tests are included.  The technology includes a Frontend with ReactJS and Bootstrap, and a Backend with Java Spring and a MySQL Database.


##  Run

Do not run the app locally. Always run (for tests as well) in a Docker environment.

The run docker images
```
shell% ./docker_build.sh
shell% ./docker_run.sh  # for AWS, wait a few minutes for container to start running Spring-Boot
shell% ./docker_run_local.sh  # for locallaptop, wait a few minutes for container to start running Spring-Boot
```
One may need to connect to a local MySQL instance by adding the flag --net="host" to the docker run command in docker_run.sh
If running locally then login with james/p*12345

### Adjust Settings

* The application port setting can be found under:  src/main/resources/application.properties
* MySQL settings (port, login) can be found under:  src/main/resources/application.properties
* A new manger can be added to MySQL using these scripts:  scripts/add_manager.sh
* MySQL DDL and DML scripts can be found under:  scripts/

## Test

The test.sh script will run backend Java /Spring tests, and then run Frontend tests using phantomJS and ReactJS.TestUtils.
The script in scripts/setup_aws_all.sh must be run first.

```
docker-shell% ./test.sh
```

### CLI Access to Spring API

To get CLI Access to the Spring API, one must first login using curl with cookie-jar:

```
shell% curl --user james:password12345 --cookie-jar ./cookies http://localhost:8092/
shell% curl --cookie cookies "http://localhost:8092/api/bookings/search/findByMonthDepartureAndYearDeparture?month=12&year=1900"
```
### AWS

To run on AWS use terraform, and the script is in ./scripts/terraform/build.sh

Example Call:
```
shell% ./scripts/terraform/build.sh 
```
Enter the RDS snapshot name.  It may take 10-20 minutes to setup, and wait a few more minutes after that for the EC2 instance with the Spring-Boot applicaiton to start

If the app does not start, then try restarting the docker container in the EC2 instance
